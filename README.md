# 16.1: Finalizing Your Problem Statement
## 1. The research question you intend to answer (in one sentence, if possible)
Identify more effective ways for predicting housing price based on given dataset. Training and tuning classification & regression models to accurately predict the price. Evaluate and compare the models' performances to identify the best one, then further scrutinize it to find the most effective features that enhance performance.
## 2. Your expected data source(s) (as either a link to existing data or a sentence describing where you will source the data from)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/animeshparikshya/house-sale-data-81-column?select=train.csv

This dataset has catagorial and numerical data with more columns. This data is the good input for the models to predict the house prices.
The dataset contains the related information like area, built year, lot size, number of bed rooms, rest rooms,sale price ...etc

## 3. The techniques you expect to use in your analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data preparation, Cleaning the data,  Understand the data, examine relationships using visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & : Reduce dimensionality to identify and retain the most significant features contributing to house price.
Clustering : Apply clustering to uncover groups of houses with similar catagories like built-year, price, area. These clusters can offer insight on sale/price patterns and may be used as additional features in the final predictive model.
Create the below models for comparision and tune it to get the accuracy for the accurecy.
K Nearest Neighbor

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine
 
## 4.The expected results
Finding the better classification algorithms model with accuracy and better performance.
## 5.Why this question is important
Housing prices veries on different parameters and conditions. Finding the best suitable model for the prediction of the house price will help.

## overview :
Fraudulent credit card transactions is a major issue in the banking sector. This project is to identify the fraudulent credit card transactions, so that the customer are not  charged for it.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data

housing price are more volatile and depends on different factors. This project is to identify more effective ways for predicting housing price
##  solve the question:

Health Indicators: age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI

Socioeconomic Factors: gender, smoking status, marital status, work type, residence type, income, rural_or_city, has_insurance

Target Variable: stroke (yes/no)



## List of 1–3 techniques that could be used to answer the question identified.:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand feature distributions, uncover patterns, and examine relationships using visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality to identify and retain the most significant features contributing to stroke risk, simplifying the modeling process.

Clustering (Unsupervised Learning): Apply clustering to uncover groups of individuals with similar health and socioeconomic profiles. These clusters can offer insight into stroke risk patterns and may be used as additional features in the final predictive model.



We will expand this section as we start learning new techniques in future modules.
