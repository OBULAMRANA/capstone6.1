# House Price Prediction Using The Dataset
## Overview :

housing price are more volatile and depends on different factors. This project is to identify more effective ways for predicting housing price

## Type of data:

The dataset will contain the house related information like area, built year, lot size, number of bed rooms,sale price ...etc

## Techniques to analyze and predict from the dataset:

Exploratory Data Analysis : Understand,Cleaning and preparation of the data, , observing the statistical measures like mean, median, ...etc and examine relationships using visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Principal Component Analysis : Reduce dimensionality to identify and retain the most significant features contributing to house price.

Clustering : Apply clustering to uncover groups of houses with similar catagories like built-year, price, area. These clusters can offer insight on sale/price patterns and may be used as additional features in the final predictive model.




## overview :
Fraudulent credit card transactions is a major issue in the banking sector. This project is to identify the fraudulent credit card transactions, so that the customer are not  charged for it.

housing price are more volatile and depends on different factors. This project is to identify more effective ways for predicting housing price
##  solve the question:

Health Indicators: age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI

Socioeconomic Factors: gender, smoking status, marital status, work type, residence type, income, rural_or_city, has_insurance

Target Variable: stroke (yes/no)



## List of 1–3 techniques that could be used to answer the question identified.:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand feature distributions, uncover patterns, and examine relationships using visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality to identify and retain the most significant features contributing to stroke risk, simplifying the modeling process.

Clustering (Unsupervised Learning): Apply clustering to uncover groups of individuals with similar health and socioeconomic profiles. These clusters can offer insight into stroke risk patterns and may be used as additional features in the final predictive model.



We will expand this section as we start learning new techniques in future modules.
